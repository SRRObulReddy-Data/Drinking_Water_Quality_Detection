# Drinking Water Quality Detection - Machine Learning 
### Problem Statement: 
The main goal of this problem is to test the quality of the drinking water with the help of its attributes like acidity, ph value, density, salt content. Since water is a basic necessity and there is always a scope of finding pollutants in it which shows negative impact on health of the one who consumes it. Generally it takes few days in order to test the quality of drinking water in laboratory and involves huge cost overheads in order to maintain the laboratory. So with the help of this model time and money can be saved in testing the quality of drinking water. 
### Dataset Information:
The Dataset consists of 2200 Records (rows) and 19 Fields (columns or attributes), out of which first 13 columns represent river attributes and the last 6 columns represent quality attributes of water.
### Objective: 
The main objective of the drinking water quality dataset is to predict which of the physiochemical features make good drinking water. This model examines the dataset and predicts the quality of water based on the 7 attributes of dataset. Random forest and SVM are used to estimate drinking water quality. The data set is trained and tested against each algorithm. Results of the algorithms are compared and the one which gives the highest accuracy is considered best to predict the quality of drinking water. 
### Design Architecture:
It mainly contains 3 modules:
  1. User Interface
  2. Connecting to database
  3. Implementing algorithms
### Process Flow:
### Data Flow 
Data flow diagrams generally depicts the flow of information in a system graphically. The flow starts from gathering the dataset, pre-processing the data, visualizing the data and ends at estimating the accuracies of the model (using Machine learning algorithms in this case).
